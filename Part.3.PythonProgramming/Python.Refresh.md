# Jypyter Notebooks and Python Refresh Homework 3

We are going to do the Python homework in a juypyter Notebook. In this homework we will review the basic principles of python programming. You will work through a few questions and build some scripts. You will need the Bloom et al Dataset found in this repository. For each question add a cell to put your answer in either as a text cell or a code cell following the question.

In lecture we will walk through the basics of programming, markdown and how to use jupyter notebooks.

### Anaconda Navigator - to get jupyter notebooks
download the [anaconda navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/install/)

### Markdown
Here is a [markdown refresh](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown)

## General concepts to refresh and lessons to review if you need them:

Here is a nice [Python_Refresh](https://pythonforbiologists.com/introduction) that goes over the majority of the basic python commands.
